## ~/.bash_profile
##
## There are 3 different types of shells in Bash: the login shell, the normal
## shell and the interactive shell.
## Login shells read /etc/profile, and only the first one found between
## '~/.bash_profile', '~/.bash_login' and '~/.profile' in this order.
## Interactive non-login shells read /etc/bashrc and ~/.bashrc.
## In this setup, ~/.bash_profile sources ~/.bashrc, which means that all
## changes made here will also take effect in a login shell.
##
## This file is sourced by all Bash *login* shells on startup.
## Follows /etc/profile.
## Precedes ~/.bash_login and ~/.profile.
